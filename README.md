<h1>OutDated Website/App</h1>

<h2>Landing and Log in page</h2>

<p>This is my landing and log in page, I wanted the landing to look simple and when you scroll down or click on get started it takes you down to the log in section.</p>

<h2>Post Page</h2>

<p>This is my post page for OutDated. I made it so that you can see your friends stories on top and the feed in the middle. I also decided to add the logout button 
at the bottom on the right. </p>
